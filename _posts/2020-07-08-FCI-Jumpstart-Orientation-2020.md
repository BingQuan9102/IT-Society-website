FCI Jumpstart Orientation 2020 will start on the **18th of July**!

Jumpstart Orientation is a programme which aims to introduce the industrial side to new students as well as expose them to practical skills that could help them tackle their university life. 

* Date: 18th July 2020
* Time: 9 am to 4 pm Malaysia Time
* Venue: Google Meet

We have prepared a coding workshop (Introduction to Web Development with HTML and GitHub), a virtual industrial sharing session and a mini competition. These activities will give you a jump-start for your academic year in MMU!

Unlike previous Jumpstarts, this year's event will be fully online. Register <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSewxcz4-69cj-sHcuBNgpRDCJpkH1amYPQKG17mXhn4h9T-mg/viewform" target="_blank">now</a> and see what we have up our sleeves. üòÅ
