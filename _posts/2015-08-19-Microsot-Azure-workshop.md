[Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com) is one of the many cloud computing platforms and infrastructures out there right now. Azure provides both PaaS (Platform as a service) and IaaS (Infrastructure as a service) to its customers.

IT Society has collaborated with Microsoft Student Partners to invite Aswin C., a Microsoft Technical Evangelist to conduct this workshop.

We will be learning how to build and deploy cloud applications on Windows Azure, and use it with Universal Apps that run across all Windows PC and Windows Phone devices.
