With Git, you can time travel to an older version of your software project, create development branches so your teammates can work on the same project simultaneously, and share your codes to sites like GitHub so you can stop sending source codes over Facebook and Dropbox.

In this workshop, we will guide you through initialising a Git repository, add files, commit changes, push them to GitHub. We will also touch on Git workflow so you know how to collaborate with others on a project.
