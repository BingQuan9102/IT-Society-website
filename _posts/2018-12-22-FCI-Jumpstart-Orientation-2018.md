FCI Jumpstart Orientation 2018 was held on the 1st of December 2018 at Multipurpose Hall, MMU Cyberjaya. The program targeted students of the Faculty of Computing and Informatics(FCI) who were in their Pre-U studies(foundation/diploma) as well as first year undergraduate students. The program aimed to provide to students a basic outlook at study life in FCI and to expose to them the current industrial expectations and needs of IT graduates.

A total of 30 participants attended the program along with 7 committee members and volunteers. The program included various agenda that centered around coding tutorials and senior sharing sessions.

Participants were introduced to basic programming concepts and also the fundamentals of web development during Introductory Coding Class. At the end of the class, participants were given a few sets of programming questions to test their problem solving skills. In Fireside Chat with Alumni, participants had the opportunity to gain first-hand advice and insights from a panel of seniors and alumni who have had experience working in the field.

The program ended with Live Coding Session, where students were engaged in a series of live coding for back-end web development using Ruby on Rails which was demonstrated by fellow alumni, Anonoz Chong and Laravel that was demonstrated by fellow senior, Shaun Goh.
