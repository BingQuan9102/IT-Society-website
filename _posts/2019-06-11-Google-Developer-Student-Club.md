Interested to take the lead for a next student club? 🤩

Developer Student Clubs (DSC) is a Google Developers program that identifies university students and helps them start a community in their campus.

These DSCs provide students with the opportunity to:

👉 Grow their knowledge on developer technologies and more through peer to peer workshops and events.

👉 Gain relevant industry experience by solving problems for local organizations with technology based solutions.

👉 Showcase their prototypes and solutions to their local community and industry leaders.

University students who lead a DSC gain access to Google technology, events, and mentorship while training their local community through fun meetups, project building activities and global competitions.
