[Laravel](http://laravel.com) is a framework which makes web development using PHP easier, and better. It is basically (and arguably) the current industry standard.

The Chief Technology Officer of [Nuffnang Malaysia](http://www.nuffnang.com.my/) and MMU alumni – Timothy Teoh – have graciously offered to run this workshop for us. We will be learning how to use the built-in REST features, and expand on them to quickly build a practical API.

This workshop will be held on 2 consecutive nights, 2 hours per session. Participants must attend both sessions, as the second session is a continuation of the first session.

Participant Requirements:

-   A working laptop
-   Basic understanding of PHP (how variables, classes and arrays work)
-   Basic understanding of MySQL (how tables relate to each other)
-   (Optional) Basic understanding of Git
