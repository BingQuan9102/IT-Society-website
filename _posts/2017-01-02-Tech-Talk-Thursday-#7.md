Tech Talk Thursdays is a series of talks and workshops organized by IT Society MMU Cyberjaya. We invite experts from the industry and academia to share with the students about the latest technology trends.

**About the talks**

In the world of business, nothing is what they appear. Among the many good people hide the treacherous hustlers waiting to exploit you. Take a wrong step and you’ll squander your hard-earned talent in a soul-crushing job. Learn how to spot dangerous people before it’s too late.

Join our talks with Y. K. Goon from [Kakitangan.com](http://Kakitangan.com)  and learn how to prevent people out there like Donald Trump take advantage of our talents do something unworthy of our time.

**Featuring Speaker**

Y.K. Goon has been programming professionally since 2002. He has been in the start up scene in various capacities. Companies he helped build include Zalora, TribeHired and [Kakitangan.com.](http://Kakitangan.com/)
