FCI Jumpstart Orientation 2020 was held successfully on the 18th of July!

This year's FCI Jumpstart Orientation is not quite similar to those in the past! It was held online through Google Meet.

The event started at 9:00 am Malaysia Time with a virtual meet and an opening speech by our director, Mohammed Shafin Arshad. Follow by that is a 2-hour workshop - Introduction to Web Development with HTML and Git, conducted by three of our students. Anas Ahmed Sirelkhatim Ahmed Sharief gave us an introduction about Web Development, Chua Bing Quan conducted an HTML coding workshop and Liew Kuan Yung taught us how to use Git. The workshop wrapped up with a short introduction to Hackerspace. (Figure 1-3)

After our lunch break, we had an Industrial Sharing Session specially conducted by IX Telecom Malaysia. Their marketing team joined our webinar and started with an introduction to their company by Miss Shirlyne. Following that, Mr Taufiq shared the industry experience and Miss Timea gave some tips on how to perform well in interviews. There were Q&A sessions throughout the sharing. The participants were quite active in the chat. The session ended with a motivation talk by Miss Huda. (Figure 4)

The Fireside chat began straight after the previous session. We invited Min Dee from Women Who Code - Kuala Lumpur, Aarief Haafiz from Peaks, and Ching June Hao from Humanise.AI, who is also our former IT Society president. Mr. Willie Poh was invited for moderating the session. The guest speakers shared their experience working in the industry and gave tons of helpful advice to the participants. (Figure 5)

Shortly after a break, our Kahoot Session is conducted. Prizes are given to the top 3 winners (Figure 6). FCI Jumpstart Orientation 2020 ended with a closing speech from our director.

The event is considered quite a success as we haven't done such a large scale of online event in the past in MMU University Cyberjaya. Once again, we would like to thank IX Telecom, all the speakers from Fireside chat and all our participants for making this event possible.
