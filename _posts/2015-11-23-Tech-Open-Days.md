The Rift is a virtual reality headset developed by Oculus VR, initially proposed as a Kickstarter campaign where it managed a staggering US2.5 million. It has since made waves in gaming and movie industries worldwide. In fact, it was so well received that competitors including, but not limited to, big name corporations like Sony, HTC/Valve have since started working on their own VR headset. Come and immerse yourself in the world of VR, where science fiction finally meets reality.

**2. Google Cardboard**

Google cardboard is a virtual reality headset developed by Google. Made entirely out of a single sheet of cardboard, using the power of modern smartphones and their inbuilt gyroscope, Google cardboard is arguably the most innovative VR headset of the lot, and certainly the most economical. Retailing at an asking price of just RM20, it is extremely affordable. But don‚Äôt let its low price fool you, as it works extremely well, giving a experience close to that of its brethren, at a fraction of the price.

As a bonus, we will be giving away Google Cardboards to 5 lucky attendees via a lucky draw.

**3. Microsoft Kinect**

Experience the revolutionary Kinect, the device that envisions a future where there will be no need for a controller to interface with a game, where we will manipulate a game‚Äôs environment directly with gestures and body movement. An extremely ambitious idea, although one that unfortunately failed to gain significant foothold in the gaming market. Still, the device is certainly unique, and while it might not be ideal for fast paced games, it works decently well in slower games.

**4. Google Glass**

Google glass is a optical head mounted display that is worn like a pair of eyeglasses. Developed with the mission of producing a ubiquitous computer. Perhaps one of the most recognisable non-released gadgets of recent times, it‚Äôs announcement and subsequent prototype release was met with generally positive response, receiving the ‚ÄòBest Inventions of the Year 2012‚Äô award from the Time magazine. However, concerns regarding it‚Äôs mediocre battery life and its high price point of USD 1500 has led to poor sales and consequently has been discontinued. Come and check out the future of computing from the visionaries at Google, barring early teething issues with technology aside, it is surely one of the most significant innovations of the last decade.

**5. Polymer**

The Polymer library is a lightweight sugaring layer on top of the [web components](http://webcomponents.org/) API‚Äôs to help in building your own web components. It adds convenient features to make it easy to build complex elements. Easily add common elements of the web with just a few lines of code, like online payment, maps navigation, and change elements of your application dynamically without using Javascript and/or a backend solution.

So what are you waiting for? That day to come when you finally get to try all these cool things out!
