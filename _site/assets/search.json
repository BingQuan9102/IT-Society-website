        "content": "\n  \n  \n\n\nChange is the law of life. And those who look only to the past or present are certain to miss the future. – J. F. Kennedy\n\nIT Society has came a long way since its inception, and every year we have been conducting various events for students to participate, as well as to act as the bridge between the faculty and the students.\n\nIn this term – 2015/16, we have decided to bring on a few changes to IT Society. We have revised our vision, direction, and club objectives. We have amended the constitution. And most of all, we are more ready than ever to make MMU and FCI a better place.\n\nHere are some of the biggest changes that you should know about.\n\nDefault Membership System\n\nIT Society’s membership is now granted, by default, to all FCI students, as well as any MMU student who agrees to the new constitution.\n\nBefore this, students had to pay RM 5 annual membership fee to become a “member”. But members of ITS are not involved in most events and activities, only the committees. And also, the fund raised from signing up members amount to less than 5% of the funds from STAD.\n\nSo we figured the best way to move forward, is to stay true to our original identity as a faculty-based society, and abolished the paid membership system.\n\nNew Divisions\n\nBy re-examining the problems we intend to solve, we have decided to abolish the 3 old divisions, namely publicity, on-campus, and off-campus, we then formed 4 new divisions:\n\nOutreach and Awareness Division\n\nThis division is set out to raise the awareness among FCI students regarding hacker culture and the current technology industry trend of Malaysia.\n\nTo do so, we reach out to industry people outside of campus, and then either try to bring them into our campus (like Startup Featurette event), or we bring students out to meet them (like Penang Trip).\n\nWe will also run a series of blog posts or podcasts to motivate students to pick up self-hacking. So they can prepare themselves for working world before they graduate.\n\nSkills Development Division\n\nThis division aims to improve FCI students’ skill set in programming and app development.\n\nWe will be conducting workshop series soon to teach programming beyond the classroom. There will be a series of Ruby on Rails workshops coming up next trimester, and it’s free of charge for all students, so stay tuned!\n\nIT Services Division\n\nHere, we make useful MMU apps for students to use, and open up APIs for students to develop on top of.\n\nCurrently, we have Hii’s MMU API. We also have several projects in the pipeline, such as a simple registration system for clubs and societies in MMU. This system will allow MMU students to join partnered clubs whenever they want to, without having to wait for them to set up booth in member registration day. We believe that systems like this will greatly benefit the campus and its citizens.\n\nIf you are interested to join the team to make useful apps together, this is the division to be in.\n\nFaculty Engagement Division\n\nAs the title suggests, this division is in charge of helping FCI improve by constantly communicating with them on the students’ behalf.\n\nTo achieve that, the team will start to do research on the current problems (too much lecture, not enough practical, for example), check out how other universities are doing, and try to come up with a case to push for a change.\n\nTransparency\n\nWe would like to be one of the most transparent and trustworthy clubs in MMU. We do that by posting our projects’ progress on a public Trello board.\n\nSince every student in MMU pays RM 100 as student activities fee, we strongly believe that you deserve to know how we spend that money. So when we start to organise events or fund programmes such as app development, we will post that onto our Trello board too.\n\nJoin Us\n\nThere has never been a better time to join IT Society MMU Cyberjaya. Here are a few ways you can join the society:\n\nFacebook Group\n\nWhether you are student, or staff, or outsiders who want to hire talents, we have create an open community on Facebook for you.\n\nCommittee\n\nBecause of the sheer number of events and projects that we run, we will be needing helps, a lot of helps, even your help.\n\nAll 4 divisions are tackling interesting problems in the campus, figure out the ones you would like to get involved in, and check out our job openings.\n\nYou will be working with the most passionate self-hackers in the campus, and you will learn a lot.\n\nHave Ideas?\n\nIf you don’t wish to commit into ITS, but you have ideas that can make things better. Don’t hesitate to let us know.\n",

We did this to help students pick up web development, and hopefully after the workshop they will continue learning to code on their own, saving their asses before graduating.\n\nIt wasn’t the first time students took teaching their peers to their own hands, in fact before this, I have myself conducted a small one-night Git introduction, simply because I feel that version control software like Git should be in every professional programmer’s toolbox. Yet Git is not taught in FCI syllabus.\n\nStudents conduct workshops on their own all the time, whether they are Microsoft Student Partners, or some ambassadors from xyz inc, without taking a single cent. They did this out of altruism, out of good will.\n\nIn IT Society, we appreciate the things you do for the students, and we would love to help you out.\n\nTell us what and when you want to teach, and we will try our best to provide:\n\n\n  Venue booking\n  Power extensions\n  Whiteboard markers and eraser\n  VGA cable\n  Nano Wi-Fi Router for trainers’ stable Internet\n  Event promotions\n\n\nThis is not just for MMU students. If you are trainers from outside, we would love to help you out too!\n\nWe look forward to what you teach next. Contact us now.\n",

Clubs and societies use it to sign up event attendees.\n\nBut, there is a problem with the phone number field. You see, if the user fills in the phone number, with a leading zero, but without a dash, Google Sheets treats it as number and will not keep the leading zero.\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\nWhere’s the leading zero?\n\nThat’s not just it, where there is no validation, expect to see all kinds of phone numbers in your responses.\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\nYou don’t want to see this right? Thank god we can do something about it, we are going to use Google Forms’ data validation. Here’s how you do it:\n\n\n  Click on the form field you want to validate.\n  Expand Advanced Settings.\n  Check Data Validation.\n  Select Regular Expression, matches, and type 0\\d{1,3}-\\d{7,9} (this matches typical Malaysian phone numbers).\n\n\nThis is how it should look like:\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\nData validation + Regular Expression = POWER OVERWHELMING\n\nSo how about MMU Student ID? Same, but the regular expression is \\d{10}. This regular expression matches anything with 10 digits.\n\nThis is how your form should be like after you implemented data validation with regex:\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\nIT Society is organising a trip to Penang on 12th – 15th November 2015.

        "content": "As many are aware, our team ran a introduction to web development on PHP earlier in the trimester. The whole idea was to:\n\n\n  provide a gentle introductory path into web development, and\n  to empower our peers with a the ability to actually build with what they have learned.\n\n\nBased on attendance at our self-hack sessions, conversations with participants and the feedback from, we may have accomplished some of (1) but very little of (2). In order to truly make a difference for our participants, the next workshop would need to see a major change in format.\n\nNext Up: Ruby on Rails\n\nOur next workshop is going to be for Ruby on Rails. It is probably the most popular web frameworks of the day, especially for rapid prototyping web applications. For this, we are thinking of several important changes to the format:\n\n\n  small group format\n  immediate hands on and application\n  a commitment deposit\n\n\nSmall Group Format\n\nOur previous workshop was run as a class. We tried to improve from session to session. First we only talked. Next we provided a live transcript. We followed that up in sessions 3 and 4 with a written tutorial instead. What we found was that the workshop turned somewhat into a code demo. Participants could try out and follow the examples, and received assistance to do so, but they didn’t have much opportunity to tinker with the code itself. We believe the latter to be the most important thing.\n\nAs such for the rails workshop, we plan to split participants into small groups of 5, where they will work through material with a mentor during the session instead of a single instructor in a classroom/lecture setting. The mentor will also have the additional role of providing guidance to participants when they attempt to put what they have learned into practice, which leads us to…\n\nApply Immediately\n\nThe previous workshop suggested that the participants should attempt at home a more challenging suggested exercise presented at the end of the class. We offered a separate session where participants can meet their mentors for further guidance, but that is right before the next workshop. We get it – it’s a little intimidating to get started figuring code out by yourself, especially when you were just rushed through two hours of code.\n\nOther than identifying a specific mentor they will be working with in a particular session, we plan to split the content to 1 hour chunks, with the following 1 hour focused on helping the workshop participant apply what they just learnt to their own project/idea.\n\nOverall there would be 2 sessions a week for 3 weeks, each taking up 2 hours. With a mentor by their side and ready assistance when they hit road blocks, we believe this format will give a bigger impact to actually empowering our participants with the needed deep understanding of the content.\n\nCommitment Deposit\n\nThe last idea is the most radical one – we’re students. We know ourselves well. It is easy to have a rosy dream at the start, but when things start getting a little tough, quitting is just … so easy. 🙂 So this is an opportunity for each participant to give themselves a little incentive to tough it out till the end.\n\nThe idea is for each participant to pay a commitment fee which will be returned to the participant by the end of the workshop, assuming that they have completed their self-declared goals/projects. Participants who fail to complete the goal forfeit this deposit (which we’ll probably put into a nice makan session for those who stuck with it till the end.)\n\nThis is not a fee. We don’t want your money, and we’re still doing this for free. It’s a self-motivation deposit.\n\nOther Carrots\n\nWe’re working out what kind of collaboration we can set up with people from the industry, in the form of industry judges for the final project presentation, or internship opportunities as prizes for winning participants. We’re also working out if we can allow students to claim assignment credit using the project they built in our workshop for the Web Development subject to be offered next trimester.\n\nBoth of these are ideas which would require collaboration from other parties, so they may or may not be in the final workshop setup.\n\nWe Want Your Feedback!\n\nSo that’s the gist of what we have in mind for our next workshop. Do you have any feedback or suggestions? Let us know in the comments below!\n",
