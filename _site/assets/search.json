        "content": "\n  \n  \n\n\nChange is the law of life. And those who look only to the past or present are certain to miss the future. – J. F. Kennedy\n\nIT Society has came a long way since its inception, and every year we have been conducting various events for students to participate, as well as to act as the bridge between the faculty and the students.\n\nIn this term – 2015/16, we have decided to bring on a few changes to IT Society. We have revised our vision, direction, and club objectives. We have amended the constitution. And most of all, we are more ready than ever to make MMU and FCI a better place.\n\nHere are some of the biggest changes that you should know about.\n\nDefault Membership System\n\nIT Society’s membership is now granted, by default, to all FCI students, as well as any MMU student who agrees to the new constitution.\n\nBefore this, students had to pay RM 5 annual membership fee to become a “member”. But members of ITS are not involved in most events and activities, only the committees. And also, the fund raised from signing up members amount to less than 5% of the funds from STAD.\n\nSo we figured the best way to move forward, is to stay true to our original identity as a faculty-based society, and abolished the paid membership system.\n\nNew Divisions\n\nBy re-examining the problems we intend to solve, we have decided to abolish the 3 old divisions, namely publicity, on-campus, and off-campus, we then formed 4 new divisions:\n\nOutreach and Awareness Division\n\nThis division is set out to raise the awareness among FCI students regarding hacker culture and the current technology industry trend of Malaysia.\n\nTo do so, we reach out to industry people outside of campus, and then either try to bring them into our campus (like Startup Featurette event), or we bring students out to meet them (like Penang Trip).\n\nWe will also run a series of blog posts or podcasts to motivate students to pick up self-hacking. So they can prepare themselves for working world before they graduate.\n\nSkills Development Division\n\nThis division aims to improve FCI students’ skill set in programming and app development.\n\nWe will be conducting workshop series soon to teach programming beyond the classroom. There will be a series of Ruby on Rails workshops coming up next trimester, and it’s free of charge for all students, so stay tuned!\n\nIT Services Division\n\nHere, we make useful MMU apps for students to use, and open up APIs for students to develop on top of.\n\nCurrently, we have Hii’s MMU API. We also have several projects in the pipeline, such as a simple registration system for clubs and societies in MMU. This system will allow MMU students to join partnered clubs whenever they want to, without having to wait for them to set up booth in member registration day. We believe that systems like this will greatly benefit the campus and its citizens.\n\nIf you are interested to join the team to make useful apps together, this is the division to be in.\n\nFaculty Engagement Division\n\nAs the title suggests, this division is in charge of helping FCI improve by constantly communicating with them on the students’ behalf.\n\nTo achieve that, the team will start to do research on the current problems (too much lecture, not enough practical, for example), check out how other universities are doing, and try to come up with a case to push for a change.\n\nTransparency\n\nWe would like to be one of the most transparent and trustworthy clubs in MMU. We do that by posting our projects’ progress on a public Trello board.\n\nSince every student in MMU pays RM 100 as student activities fee, we strongly believe that you deserve to know how we spend that money. So when we start to organise events or fund programmes such as app development, we will post that onto our Trello board too.\n\nJoin Us\n\nThere has never been a better time to join IT Society MMU Cyberjaya. Here are a few ways you can join the society:\n\nFacebook Group\n\nWhether you are student, or staff, or outsiders who want to hire talents, we have create an open community on Facebook for you.\n\nCommittee\n\nBecause of the sheer number of events and projects that we run, we will be needing helps, a lot of helps, even your help.\n\nAll 4 divisions are tackling interesting problems in the campus, figure out the ones you would like to get involved in, and check out our job openings.\n\nYou will be working with the most passionate self-hackers in the campus, and you will learn a lot.\n\nHave Ideas?\n\nIf you don’t wish to commit into ITS, but you have ideas that can make things better. Don’t hesitate to let us know.\n",

We did this to help students pick up web development, and hopefully after the workshop they will continue learning to code on their own, saving their asses before graduating.\n\nIt wasn’t the first time students took teaching their peers to their own hands, in fact before this, I have myself conducted a small one-night Git introduction, simply because I feel that version control software like Git should be in every professional programmer’s toolbox. Yet Git is not taught in FCI syllabus.\n\nStudents conduct workshops on their own all the time, whether they are Microsoft Student Partners, or some ambassadors from xyz inc, without taking a single cent. They did this out of altruism, out of good will.\n\nIn IT Society, we appreciate the things you do for the students, and we would love to help you out.\n\nTell us what and when you want to teach, and we will try our best to provide:\n\n\n  Venue booking\n  Power extensions\n  Whiteboard markers and eraser\n  VGA cable\n  Nano Wi-Fi Router for trainers’ stable Internet\n  Event promotions\n\n\nThis is not just for MMU students.

        "content": "As many are aware, our team ran a introduction to web development on PHP earlier in the trimester. The whole idea was to:\n\n\n  provide a gentle introductory path into web development, and\n  to empower our peers with a the ability to actually build with what they have learned.\n\n\nBased on attendance at our self-hack sessions, conversations with participants and the feedback from, we may have accomplished some of (1) but very little of (2). In order to truly make a difference for our participants, the next workshop would need to see a major change in format.\n\nNext Up: Ruby on Rails\n\nOur next workshop is going to be for Ruby on Rails. It is probably the most popular web frameworks of the day, especially for rapid prototyping web applications. For this, we are thinking of several important changes to the format:\n\n\n  small group format\n  immediate hands on and application\n  a commitment deposit\n\n\nSmall Group Format\n\nOur previous workshop was run as a class. We tried to improve from session to session. First we only talked. Next we provided a live transcript. We followed that up in sessions 3 and 4 with a written tutorial instead. What we found was that the workshop turned somewhat into a code demo. Participants could try out and follow the examples, and received assistance to do so, but they didn’t have much opportunity to tinker with the code itself. We believe the latter to be the most important thing.\n\nAs such for the rails workshop, we plan to split participants into small groups of 5, where they will work through material with a mentor during the session instead of a single instructor in a classroom/lecture setting. The mentor will also have the additional role of providing guidance to participants when they attempt to put what they have learned into practice, which leads us to…\n\nApply Immediately\n\nThe previous workshop suggested that the participants should attempt at home a more challenging suggested exercise presented at the end of the class. We offered a separate session where participants can meet their mentors for further guidance, but that is right before the next workshop. We get it – it’s a little intimidating to get started figuring code out by yourself, especially when you were just rushed through two hours of code.\n\nOther than identifying a specific mentor they will be working with in a particular session, we plan to split the content to 1 hour chunks, with the following 1 hour focused on helping the workshop participant apply what they just learnt to their own project/idea.\n\nOverall there would be 2 sessions a week for 3 weeks, each taking up 2 hours. With a mentor by their side and ready assistance when they hit road blocks, we believe this format will give a bigger impact to actually empowering our participants with the needed deep understanding of the content.\n\nCommitment Deposit\n\nThe last idea is the most radical one – we’re students. We know ourselves well. It is easy to have a rosy dream at the start, but when things start getting a little tough, quitting is just … so easy. 🙂 So this is an opportunity for each participant to give themselves a little incentive to tough it out till the end.\n\nThe idea is for each participant to pay a commitment fee which will be returned to the participant by the end of the workshop, assuming that they have completed their self-declared goals/projects. Participants who fail to complete the goal forfeit this deposit (which we’ll probably put into a nice makan session for those who stuck with it till the end.)\n\nThis is not a fee. We don’t want your money, and we’re still doing this for free. It’s a self-motivation deposit.\n\nOther Carrots\n\nWe’re working out what kind of collaboration we can set up with people from the industry, in the form of industry judges for the final project presentation, or internship opportunities as prizes for winning participants. We’re also working out if we can allow students to claim assignment credit using the project they built in our workshop for the Web Development subject to be offered next trimester.\n\nBoth of these are ideas which would require collaboration from other parties, so they may or may not be in the final workshop setup.\n\nWe Want Your Feedback!\n\nSo that’s the gist of what we have in mind for our next workshop. Do you have any feedback or suggestions? Let us know in the comments below!\n",

IT Society sincerely apologise for the absence of such awesome device 🙁\n\nA showcase for the awesome tech gadgets that modern technology has brought us, IT Society is proud to present Tech Open Days. Besides being able to play with the latest gadgets, you will also have to opportunity to learn how to build awesome stuff on top of what we have today.\n\nGadgets we will provide for attendees to try on include:\n\n\n  Oculus Rift\n\n\nUpdate: Sorry guys! Our partner has decided not to lend us the Rift because the device is required for their FYP. IT Society sincerely apologise for the absence of such awesome device 🙁\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\nThe Rift is a virtual reality headset developed by Oculus VR, initially proposed as a Kickstarter campaign where it managed a staggering US2.5 million. It has since made waves in gaming and movie industries worldwide. In fact, it was so well received that competitors including, but not limited to, big name corporations like Sony, HTC/Valve have since started working on their own VR headset. Come and immerse yourself in the world of VR, where science fiction finally meets reality.\n\n2. Google Cardboard\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\nGoogle cardboard is a virtual reality headset developed by Google. Made entirely out of a single sheet of cardboard, using the power of modern smartphones and their inbuilt gyroscope, Google cardboard is arguably the most innovative VR headset of the lot, and certainly the most economical. Retailing at an asking price of just RM20, it is extremely affordable. But don’t let its low price fool you, as it works extremely well, giving a experience close to that of its brethren, at a fraction of the price.\n\nAs a bonus, we will be giving away Google Cardboards to 5 lucky attendees via a lucky draw.\n\n3. Microsoft Kinect\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\nExperience the revolutionary Kinect, the device that envisions a future where there will be no need for a controller to interface with a game, where we will manipulate a game’s environment directly with gestures and body movement. An extremely ambitious idea, although one that unfortunately failed to gain significant foothold in the gaming market. Still, the device is certainly unique, and while it might not be ideal for fast paced games, it works decently well in slower games.\n\n4. Google Glass\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\nGoogle glass is a optical head mounted display that is worn like a pair of eyeglasses. Developed with the mission of producing a ubiquitous computer. Perhaps one of the most recognisable non-released gadgets of recent times, it’s announcement and subsequent prototype release was met with generally positive response, receiving the ‘Best Inventions of the Year 2012’ award from the Time magazine. However, concerns regarding it’s mediocre battery life and its high price point of USD 1500 has led to poor sales and consequently has been discontinued. Come and check out the future of computing from the visionaries at Google, barring early teething issues with technology aside, it is surely one of the most significant innovations of the last decade.\n\n5. Polymer\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\nThe Polymer library is a lightweight sugaring layer on top of the web components API’s to help in building your own web components. It adds convenient features to make it easy to build complex elements. Easily add common elements of the web with just a few lines of code, like online payment, maps navigation, and change elements of your application dynamically without using Javascript and/or a backend solution.\n\nSo what are you waiting for? That day to come when you finally get to try all these cool things out!\n",

        "excerpt": "Last semester, we have ran an Introduction to Web Development with PHP workshop series in MMU. The objective of the event is not just to teach them how to use PHP to make web apps, but to empower them to self-hack more – to make things on their own.\n\n",
        "content": "Last semester, we have ran an Introduction to Web Development with PHP workshop series in MMU. The objective of the event is not just to teach them how to use PHP to make web apps, but to empower them to self-hack more – to make things on their own.\n\nUnfortunately, we didn’t achieve that objective. So we started to think of ways to help us get closer to our objective when we run another workshop.\n\nSo this semester, we decided to run Ruby on Rails workshop, and we want to run it a lot better. Before the workshop begins, Bruce, the workshop director wrote this blog post to explain how.\n\nFast forward to now, we have finished conducting the 3 weeks long Ruby on Rails workshop, so, did the changes work? Yes.\n\nCommitment Deposit Works\n\nWe didn’t charge a single cent for participants of PHP workshop. 80 students joined the 1st session, but at the end, only 20 remained for the 4th one. We have also asked them to present what they have done in our Hackerspace weekly meetup, none came.\n\nThe effective way to learn things is by doing it, not just by listening to lecture, try the tutorials out, but by actually using it to solve problem – to make your own web apps. Otherwise it’s just as good as you have learned nothing.\n\nSo, in Rails workshop, we have decided to ask students to put down a deposit of RM50. The deposit will only be returned at the end of the workshop, only if they have managed to complete their own projects, and not just the example app we build in tutorial.\n\nIn short, it worked. 10 students have came to Hackerspace and presented what they done. This is a huge improvement over the last workshop we did!\n\nAllocating Time for Own Project\n\nIn PHP workshop, we did not ask the participants to think of what they wish to build. Instead, we just asked them to follow through our tutorial and call it a day.\n\nThat wasn’t empowering at all. So this time, we asked them to think of a web app they wish to build, of reasonable difficulty. Then in each session, we allocate 1 hour for the lecture/demo, 1 hour to work on their final project, with guidance and help from mentors.\n\nSome of them already have a startup they want to do, some of them just cincai came up with a project just to get back RM50. But either way, they have managed to apply what they have learned from the workshops, to work on their own problem.\n\nPeople just feel more empowered when they work on their own thing. You will remember things better, not when you are simply just following others’ foot prints, but when you figure out your own paths.\n\nUse Cloud Development Environment\n\nMost of the students in MMU use Windows, and Ruby on Rails just don’t run well on it. So we asked students to install Virtual Box, Vagrant, and Git so they can develop Rails app on Windows.\n\nUnfortunately, the installation is not straightforward at all. Most students don’t understand what is Vagrant, what is VM, what is going on, how the whole dev environment works, wondering why commands don’t work (confused between in Windows and in VM SSH).\n\nHell, Lenovo laptops don’t allow virtualisation without enabling it in BIOS, we didn’t know that!\n\nIt was frustrating and confusing.\n\nOne of our students just can’t run anything, because their OS is 32-bit and the RAM is just 2GB. So we have advised her to use Cloud9.\n\nAgain, it worked! They quickly caught up to 2nd lecture. They didn’t need to set up anything, and simply need to focus on Rails. After all, our workshop was never about teaching them how to configure virtual machine, Vagrant, and confused between which environment they are typing their commands in. Using cloud development environment has helped us to stick to our focus – Rails!\n\nUse Labs Maybe\n\nWhen we conduct the workshop in classroom, we have issues getting power supply to every laptop (we have enough power extensions, actually), and fast Internet connectivity to all the participants (later solved with Apple Airport Express).\n\nSo for last few sessions, we have decided to try using one of the labs in FCI. Each seat has power sockets, and LAN cable, so we have solved the power supply and internet speed issue.\n\nHowever, our group formations have broken up. All the students were facing the projector screen and lecturer, and the groups we have formed earlier? Gone.\n\nIt’s a trade off. If we can solve the power supply and Internet speed issue, actually we did later on, we should try to use classrooms as much as possible. It’s just better for the social experience.\n\nMentors-mentees ratio\n\nIn PHP workshop, we have a small mentor to mentee ratio, as a result, each student gets too little attention from each mentor. Not very good.\n\nSo this time around, we know we only have 5 mentors (actually 3, 1 have to skip first 4 sessions because his replacement classes clashed with the workshop, and 1 bailed out last minute), so we decided to take in only 25 students.\n\nDespite our effort to keep the ratio small, we still didn’t manage to pay each student enough attention. If possible, in our next Rails workshop, we may need to recruit our alumni to help out as mentors.\n\nConclusion\n\nWe have managed to iterate on our format in order to really get to our core objectives. And we can still see further steps it can be improved upon. The feeling of growth is a great feeling to have.\n\nWe are really happy that students have managed to complete the course, built their own thing, and hopefully can make a living out of what they learned.\n\nTo those who will be conducting workshops in near future, we hope that you will not make the same mistakes we did, and feel free to emulate some of these practices that we have found works!\n\nThanks for reading 🙂\n",

        "excerpt": "\n  \n  \n\n\nDisclaimer: It’s against MMU’s policy to deploy your own wireless access points. Do this at your own risk.\n\n",
        "content": "\n  \n  \n\n\nDisclaimer: It’s against MMU’s policy to deploy your own wireless access points. Do this at your own risk.\n\nAt a meager speed of 0.5Mbps, MMU WiFi is not exactly a fast WiFi. If you are expecting a huge number of outsiders coming to your event, you can ask ITSD to open up the Open WiFi – the one with no password. But again, it’s only 0.5Mbps with terrible latency.\n\nSo how did we provide fast Internet to many people in our events?\n\nEthernet port = 100Mbps\n\nMost ethernet ports in MMU Cyberjaya provide Internet as fast as 100Mbps. We tested this in MPH (stage’s computer), FCI labs, classrooms, and lecturers’ rooms. Unfortunately we didn’t test it in all the places, and MPH extension seems to have a terrible Internet speed of 4Mbps.\n\nRouter’s max users count\n\nMost cheapo routers can only support 10 – 15 users before breaking up. If you use UniFi and Maxis Home Fiber, and you experience tons of disconnections and instability, it probably is not because of the line, it’s mostly likely because of your router not being able to support that many users.\n\n\n  \n  \n\n)\n\nCurrently, I stay in a Cyberia townhouse that has 9 occupants with 25 devices. Every night we have to restart the Asus router 3 – 4 times with no luck of getting a stable connection.\n\nI ended up buying an Apple AirPort Extreme, which Apple claims to support 50 users, and put in the house. We’ve almost never restarted the router ever since.\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\nOf course, Airport Extreme is a bit of an overkill. For a much lower price, AirPort Express can support 50 users as well.\n\nAlthough AirPort Express’s WAN port only supports 100Mbps, but it’s good enough for MMU, because MMU’s ethernet port is only 100Mbps too.\n\nHow did it go?\n\nAfter the frustration of terrible Internet for first 2 classes of Ruby on Rails workshop, I decided to buy an AirPort Express and see how it fares.\n\nIt’s solid.\n\nStudents no longer experience disconnections and slow speed. In fact the speed we’ve got is around 90~ Mbps, well enough to perform bundle install and download vagrant boxes.\n\nHow did it perform in larger events?\n\nTo test that, I deployed it in IT Career Week, where 19 companies will be setting up booths, streaming HD recruitment videos, and giving career talks.\n\nWith AirPort Utility app, the router peaked at 35 clients, and for 2 days, we didn’t receive a single complaint of Internet disconnection.\n\ntl;dr\n\nBuy AirPort Express. It’s awesome.\n",
