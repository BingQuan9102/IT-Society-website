&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the talks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve been building apps from the very beginning when smartphone operating systems decided to open up themselves to third party developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What seemed to be an obscure hobby soon became a widely demanded trade and new projects kept on knocking at our doors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the gloriously brilliant to the downright absurd, we picked our battles and from there we’ve had the pleasure of building some really great apps for some startups that turned Unicorns like MyTeksi (Grab), iMoney, Says and more.&lt;br /&gt;
We want to share with you the insights we’ve gained from our experiences and the lessons we’ve learned from our mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if you are an aspiring app developer, entrepreneur or just your regular tech geek, come spend an evening with us!&lt;/p&gt;
