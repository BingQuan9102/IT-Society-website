&lt;p&gt;Interested to take the lead for a next student club? ü§©&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developer Student Clubs (DSC) is a Google Developers program that identifies university students and helps them start a community in their campus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These DSCs provide students with the opportunity to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;üëâ Grow their knowledge on developer technologies and more through peer to peer workshops and events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;üëâ Gain relevant industry experience by solving problems for local organizations with technology based solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;üëâ Showcase their prototypes and solutions to their local community and industry leaders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;University students who lead a DSC gain access to Google technology, events, and mentorship while training their local community through fun meetups, project building activities and global competitions.&lt;/p&gt;
